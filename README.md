# Bachelors of Science in Computer Science
## Classes made publicly Available
### Disclaimer: 

Most CS courses do not have full assignments created and are merely the syllabus and lecture notes. Some do, notably Computational Theory (out of the textbook) and Operating Systems (with assignments and solutions). A few courses are currently missing. I will do my best to try and fill in the gaps of the missing classes over time.

## A special "Thank you!"

I would like to thank my computer science and mathematics professors and the CS and MA departments at [Plymouth State University](https://www.plymouth.edu/) for making this possible.
A special thanks to professors Nat Tuck, Zhizhang Shen, Peter Drexel and Shawn Case!
